Today I set up my Second Brain. This is where I'll capture thoughts, decisions, and learnings.

## What I'm thinking about

- Building [[concepts/knowledge-management|better systems for remembering things]]
- Making [[decisions/second-brain-stack|technology choices]] that last

## Goals for this week

1. Get the basics working
2. Start capturing daily notes
3. Link ideas together
