# Learning: Write Things Down

## The Lesson

If you don't write it down, you'll forget it. Period.

## How I Learned This

Lost countless good ideas by thinking "I'll remember that later."

Spoiler: I never did.

## What Changed

Now I capture everything immediately:
- Ideas → Quick note
- Decisions → Decision doc with context
- Lessons → Learning entry like this one

## The Result

My brain is calmer. I don't waste mental energy trying to remember things. It's all here.
