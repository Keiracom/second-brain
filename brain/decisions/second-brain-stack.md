# Decision: Second Brain Tech Stack

## Context

I need a personal knowledge base that's fast, beautiful, and easy to maintain.

## Options Considered

1. **Notion** - Too slow, vendor lock-in
2. **Obsidian Publish** - Good but costs money monthly
3. **Custom Next.js app** - Full control, free hosting

## Decision

**Custom Next.js app** reading from local markdown files.

## Reasoning

- Own my data (plain markdown files)
- Deploy free on Vercel
- Can customize exactly how I want
- Learn Next.js better in the process

## Outcome

TBD - just getting started!
