# Knowledge Management

The art of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information effectively.

## Core Principles

### 1. Capture Everything
Don't trust your memory. Write it down immediately.

### 2. Connect Ideas
Knowledge becomes powerful when linked. Every note should connect to others.

### 3. Review Regularly
Information decays without reinforcement. Schedule time to revisit.

## Tools I've Tried

| Tool | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| Notion | Flexible, pretty | Slow, complex |
| Obsidian | Fast, local-first | Learning curve |
| Apple Notes | Simple, syncs | Limited linking |

## Code Example

Here's a simple way to link notes in markdown:

```markdown
[[folder/note-name|Display Text]]
```

This creates a bidirectional link that helps build your knowledge graph.
